It allows a court to decide to not make a mandatory prohibition order provided for under a provision of that Act — or to add conditions or vary any of the conditions set out in that provision — if the court considers it just and reasonable to do so. It requires the court to provide its reasons for making such a decision. It requires a court to consider all available options prior to imposing a minimum punishment of imprisonment or period of parole ineligibility under a provision of that Act, and to provide written reasons for imposing a minimum punishment of imprisonment or period of parole ineligibility. It gives a court discretion in the treatment or counselling program that a person who has been found guilty of an offence may attend and removes the requirement for the Attorney General to give his or her consent in order to delay sentencing under subsection 720(2) of that Act. It provides that a judge is to take into consideration the recommendation of the jury in setting the period of parole ineligibility for a person who has been found guilty of first or second degree murder.	2020/09/30	\N	https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10873552	https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/10873560	\N	2021-01-21 01:04:18.191823
